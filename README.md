## Useful Facts:

VuePress will generate a static site.

* Static images go in /doc/.vuepress/public
* You _must_ have a ReadMe.md in the directory which is defined as the root (when you start up the simulator, or whatever)
* You have to set up the nav-bar using the /doc/.vuepress/config.js
* You don't have to use the docs directory, you specify the source when you `vuepress dev [docs]`, or whatever
