KTS is a vehicle for me (Mark Goldthorp) to perform various software engineering tasks. I started professional life as a Software Engineer, and slid sideways into Software Quality Management. Currently, KTS provides websites for a budding filmmaker / producer. This involves all the ordinary stuff (PHP, HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, ...), as well as doing some video editing, audio editing, as well as image munging. I have recently discovered Vue.JS, and like that more than I like PHP - either that is because I am not using PHP correctly, or it is just not the ideal tool fo the job that I am doing.
