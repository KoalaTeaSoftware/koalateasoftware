VuePress is (really) a static site generator (meaning that you have a build process in between writing, and deploying your site). It is based on Vue.js, however, so there would appear to be no good reason why you should have a wholly static site. You could, for example, tell the component that populates your list of articles to go to some database / filestore and populate the list from whatever it finds there.
