# Recent Professional Experience

### Jan. 20 - present: Koala Tea Software: Web Dev. &amp; Test Automation Engineer

**Main Achievements:** Since returning to the UK, I have written / re-written the following web sites: swordsandclapboards.com/, rosegoldthorp.com, [the-greenlands.com](https://the-greenlands.com/), and a few others. I am not satisfied with the performance of the WP CMS, and am working on a solution that uses Vue.js, and Firebase (for authentication, and storage). I am also not convinced that the separate Java/Cucumber test framework QC strategy is best for these projects and I have WebdriverIO on the roadmap.

**Systems:**

- **Under Development:** Web sites. **Technologies:** Shared hosting using PHP / HTML / Bootstrap / JavaScript / CSS (SCSS) / SVGMySQL provided a user database on some. Some have integrations with WordPress (as a CMS), MailChimp, Instagram, and other APIs. PHPStorm is the IDE. Version control manage using GitHub, GitHub actions calling the Cucumber tests provide CI/CD gateways.
- **Under Development:** Test framework for Functional Test. **Technologies:** Maven / Java / Cucumber / Selenium / WebDriver. Using page object model and other best practices. Also calling 3rd party tools such as the W3C valuators

**Tasks:**

- Liaise with business stakeholders to collect requirements, build sites (including graphics, video editing), deploy to stage and live servers.
- **Manual Testing** : Chrome Lighthouse **,** and similar tools (mostly during development); **Experimental** testing of look and operation using PC, iPad, iOS and Android phones (both in &#39;stage&#39; and in &#39;live&#39;).
- **Automated testing** : Cucumber / Java / Maven test framework (a general framework which I built and tailored for the specific test requirements). The W3C test facilities are made available through this framework, and I am going to integrate RESTful API testing into it. [http://koalateasoftware.com/](http://koalateasoftware.com/) offers shifting snapshots of this testing.
- Re-evaluated development approach: Stuck with LAMP (existing experience; the excessive time that Word Press, and others, would take to get the desired UI; easy integrations with other tools).
- Evaluated free IDEs: Chose IntelliJ (out of box support for Maven, excellent text completion, extensive experience from recent contracts, good support for the rest of the environment ...), and **PHPStorm**.
- Evaluated free VCS solutions: Chose on **GitHub** (both **GitHub** , or **BitBucket** have been sufficient, so far, but stuck with **GitHub** )
- Evaluated free fault management apps: Chose **YouTrack** (low initial barrier to use, good integration with existing development tools)
- Evaluated [**Cucumber Studio**](https://cucumber.io/): Rejected as too much for these projects, with not enough benefit
- Evaluated [Zenkit](https://zenkit.com/en/): Also did not provide sufficient benefit for these projects
- Evaluated Wikis: Used MediaWiki, but disappointed by its slow performance, now using [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/)
- Evaluated data management / collaboration options for client: Chose Dropbox over the Google Drive _et. al._ (small, but effective), but having to migrate to OneDrive (for Word, etc)

**Other CPD:**

- Writing a Progressing Web App as a mobile app (entertainment) HTML / JavaScript / SCSS / Firebase / GitHub / Stripe (pmnt handling) graphical assets are prepared, coding in-hand.

### Jun. 19 – Dec. 19: Sky Network Television Limited: Senior Test Automation Engineer 

> Cucumber / Gherkin / Java, WinAppDriver, BitBucket, Jenkins

**Main Achievements** : Reduced the time-to-write of many automated tests by about ½, by extending the Page Object Model to what could be called the Widget Object Model.
